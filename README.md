## Context of implementation

The Builder is a crational pattern that let construct complex(by complex we mean objects with many fields and/or containing nested objects ) objects steps by steps. The intent of this pattern is to separate the construction of an object and its representation that is we can create differents instance of the same class without having to modify the code of the Class.

## implementation

We have decided to use the builder pattern to create a game of Versus Fighting between two Robots that the player can customize thanks to the builder pattern. Each part of the Robots can be choose by the player with various bonuses
